# Genome Wide Association Studies ( GWAS)

Using tutorials and techniques instructed by MareesAT (https://github.com/MareesAT/GWA_tutorial ) as a step by step guide to analyze the genetic data sample provided by my institution. The sample data is referred to as Step1.

# Introduction 
GWAS study consists of four steps for its data analysis as follows
- Quality Control
- Population stratification
- Association
- Polygenic Risk Score (PRS)

The first three steps are dependent of each other i.e. the output of the previous step is the input of the next step.

# Methodology
This study requires an access to a Linux-based computer resource and also requires programming language such as R and whole genome association analysis software called PLINK (of their latest version)

## For each step, separate scripts will be available to showcase all the commands that i will use in-order to complete the study.
